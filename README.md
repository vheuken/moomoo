Listen to music with friends.

Currently undergoing a rewrite.

The original version used Node.js. I'm rewriting it in Clojure for various reason (namely Node's poor handling of CPU intensive tasks, limited asyncronous tools, and less robust libraries).

To have a look at the original Node code, [visit the "pre-rewrite" branch](https://github.com/vheuken/moomoo/tree/pre-rewrite/)
