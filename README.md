Listen to music with friends.

Currently undergoing a rewrite.

The original version used Node.js. I'm rewriting it in Clojure for various reason (namely hashing being very CPU intensive and not wanting to have to manage a separate service for hashing).

To have a look at the original Node code, [visit the "pre-rewrite" branch](https://github.com/vheuken/moomoo/tree/pre-rewrite/)
